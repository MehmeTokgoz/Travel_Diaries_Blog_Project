# SHA Final-Project: Travel Diaries Blog


## Overview

It is a travel diary blog. The basis of the project is to allow users to share their travel diaries and help others with their travel plans. I used MongoDB for the database, as well as Node.js & Express.js for the back-end, and ReactJS and Material UI for the front-end. The challenges i faced was to learn json web token and authentification of users and passing props between pages and components.

## Description

This is an application created with MERN stack. Users can share their travel diaries and give an idea to others who want to go to travel.

The blog can be used without registration or as a registration. Users can review all diaries and browse diaries by location, without registration. After registration, users can share update, delete their diaries.

This project created using MERN Stack. **MERN Stack** was preferred for this project because it allows faster application development using only javascript and without combining different programming languages.  

**MongoDB** is a high-performance, cost-effective database system with a schemaless database feature.  

**Express.js** was used with Node.js, as it links easily and fast to databases.  

**React**, and Material UI were used to enhance the web design.  

**Node.js** was chosen for this application, as it is lightweight, efficient, has good performance, and is very fast in building web applications. In addition, there is a vast amount of tools in npm to support the developer.

The goal of this project was to build an application from scratch and reinforce what has been learned. So, created RESTful APIs, the users get authenticated via a token, using the JsonWebToken library, used React states, props, and components.  

## Installation

The project is uploaded to Github.

To get the project on your computer follow these steps:
1. Fork the project's repository to your Github account
2. Clone the repository from your Github account to your local hard drive `git clone [url]`
3. Open a command prompt and go to the project's repository
4. Type `npm install` to install the node package dependencies
5. Type `npm start` to run the server
6. The server should be available at `http://localhost:4000` and the application at `http://localhost:5173`

In case the application doesn't start at `http://localhost:4000` then:
1. At the command prompt go to the projects repository and then inside the folder *client* by typing `cd client`
2. Then type `npm run dev` to start React
